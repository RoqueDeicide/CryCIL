{
	//! This typedef is here to represent a reference to an object located within managed heap.
	//!
	//! Details:
	//!
	//! Pointers of this type are returned from a bunch of API calls, they are
	//! also used to pass arguments to managed methods.
	//!
	//! Always bear in mind that these are references to objects that are watched
	//! over by a .Net/Mono garbage collector (GC). This means that if GC has no
	//! information about references to a specific object, it will be removed during
	//! the next session of garbage collection, and even if there are live references
	//! to the object from managed code, it can be moved during heap compression.
	//!
	//! GC never tracks unmanaged references to objects (you can recognize these
	//! references by them being of type mono::object). This makes usage of mono::object
	//! references very dangerous, because the reference can become invalid without
	//! your consent at any point in time.
	//!
	//! Also, you have no direct access to Mono API that works with objects,
	//! therefore there is only a handful of ways they can be used.
	//!
	//! Using mono::object instances:
	//!
	//! There is only a handful of API functions that accept mono::object instances, so the
	//! main use of these [instances] is:
	//!     1) Storage of references to the result of method invocation.
	//!     2) Storage of references to the arguments that need to be passed to the
	//!        method when it's invoked.
	//!     3) Storage of references to unhandled exceptions that were thrown during
	//!        invocation of the unmanaged thunk.
	//!
	//! In order to access Mono API for objects and/or make its usage more safe,
	//! mono::object instances require to be wrapped around by an object of type
	//! IMonoHandle.
	//!
	//! There are three types of objects that implement IMonoHandle:
	//!     1) Free       : This is the most simple wrapper and the least safe one:
	//!                     It only provides access to object's API and nothing more.
	//!
	//!     2) Persistent : This is the best type of handle to use when there is a need
	//!                     to keep a reference to the object for prolonged periods of
	//!                     time. GC will not remove the object when there is at least
	//!                     one persistent IMonoHandle active. You must, however, call
	//!                     Release method when you don't need it, otherwise a memory
	//!                     leak will be created. Accessing the object held by a persistent
	//!                     wrapper requires some code to be executed, therefore it is
	//!                     only recommended to use this type of wrapper when you only
	//!                     access the object rarely.
	//!
	//!     3) Pinned     : This type is similar to Persistent IMonoHandle in the sense
	//!                     that the object won't be deleted by GC while there is an active
	//!                     handle. The difference however is that pinned handle will also
	//!                     instruct GC to not even Move the object during heap compression.
	//!                     This makes accessing object wrapped by the handle faster, but it
	//!                     creates performance issues with garbage collection.
	//!                     Only use this type of handle if you have a reference to the object
	//!                     that you keep for a somewhat long period of time and you need to
	//!                     access it frequently. Just like with persistent handles, you need
	//!                     to release them when you don't need them.
	//!
	//! You can use IMonoInterface::CreateObject() function to create object that
	//! already has wrapping.
	//!
	//! You can use IMonoInterface::WrapObject() function to create a wrapper for
	//! mono::object instance when you to work with it or keep it.
	typedef class MonoObject *object;

	//! Typedefs marked by this define represent a reference to an object that is located
	//! within managed memory. Technically all of them are equivalents to mono::object
	//! but they can be used to designate what the object is supposed to be.
	//!
	//! In C++'s analog for mono::object is void *. Both can be casted to whatever type
	//! like bool *. The same can be done to mono::object.
	//!
	//! Examples:
	//!
	//! // The following two methods are technically the same, they are both are unmanaged
	//! thunks of static String.IsNullOrWhitespace method, but the last one uses OBJECT_NAME
	//! typedefs do describe the types of objects better.
	//!
	//! @code{.cpp}
	//! bool __stdcall IsNullOrWhitespace(mono::object text, mono::object    *exception);
	//!
	//! bool __stdcall IsNullOrWhitespace(mono::string text, mono::exception *exception);
