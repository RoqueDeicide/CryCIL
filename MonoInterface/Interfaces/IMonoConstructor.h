//! Represents a constructor function in Mono.
//!
//! Constructors are always instance methods and when invoked using Invoke() with null passed as an
//! instance, they create a new object and initialize it. You cannot polymorph a constructor.
//!
//! WARNING: Due to virtual inheritance if you want to cast IMonoFunction to IMonoConstructor, don't use
//!          C-style downcasts, use dynamic_cast operator instead. (/GR compiler option is necessary).
